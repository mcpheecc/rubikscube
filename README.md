# Rubiks Cube
Python program that solves a 3x3 rubiks cube

# Running the program
cubedraft.py runs in Python. The scramble string is located on line 914 and was taken from a random generator at https://ruwix.com/puzzle-scramble-generator/?type=rubiks-cube. Algorithm strings should be entered in all caps. If a string has a character such as R2 it should be entered as RR, similarly if a string has a character such as F' it should be entered as FFF.

# Design notes
The design notes are found in design.md which explain the math behind some of the functions and solving the rubiks cube.
